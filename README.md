### **KNOWN BROKEN SETS**
Written before the first test. We'll see soon.

### What if it breaks  

I'm almost certainly missing some set codes from MTGO. Basing this off my collection. Try to use MTGO2Decked again, but with your javascript console open.
Make an issue with the text found there, and the actual set name of the card that caused it if you can tell.
